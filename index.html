                <h4>Custom design is the name of the game. That means before we create your site we need to get some
                    information from you about how you want the site designed.</h4>

                <h4>Process:</h4>

                <h4>Consultation</h4>
                <p>We are able to complete the consultation process in a variety of ways.</p>
                <p>We can complete it through email.</p>
                <p>We can complete it over the phone.</p>
                <p>We can complete it via Zoom.</p>
                <p>Due to personal issues we are currently avoiding meeting in person, but if absolutely necessary and
                    at least once during the process we will. This is usually during the launch.</p>
                <h4>Hosting</h4>
                <p>For your security we will connect you with a hosting service so that you own the account where your
                    site is being hosted.</p>
                <h4>Domain</h4>
                <p>If you do not own your domain yet, you can register one through the hosting site.</p>
                <p>If you already own your domain we will work with you to ensure your domain points to your new site.
                </p>
                <h4>Launch</h4>
                <p>If you have someone already in mind to launch the site we will provide the files directly to you.</p>
                <p>If you need us to launch the site for you (which we do at no additional charge) we will launch the
                    site by making use of your SFTP username and password provided by the hosting service.</p>
                <p>For your security we will not have access to the account itself.</p>
                </ul>
                <h4>The per-page rates may change as the years go on. However; Silverfox Sites offers a monthly
                    maintenance fee and payment cost retainer. For $50 per month we will perform small updates as they
                    are needed and you will retain in perpetuity your per page rate even as we gain more experience.

                    build a website all at once. Even though they know they need one. To that end we have multiple
                    payment options available.</h4>
                <h4>Full price upfront.</h4>
                <p>For some companies it is easier for them to pay everything up front and be done with it.</p>
                <h4>50% upfront/50% on delivery</h4>
                <p>So far, our most popular payment package.</p>
                <h4>Phased Rollout</h4>
                <p>Since all packages come with a stated per page rate this allows you to pay for pages as they launch.
                </p>
                <p>A phased rollout can be done in either the full payment upfront or in the 50%/50% pricing options.
